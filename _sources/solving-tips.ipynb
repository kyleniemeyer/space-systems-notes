    "In many problems we need to solve an equation. For example, let's think about solving $f(x) = g$.\n",
    "This means we want to find the value $x$ that satisfies this equation.\n",
    "One way to to think about this is that we want find the root of $f(x) - g = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the equation is complicated, nonlinear, and/or transcendental, we probably cannot find\n",
    "the root analytically, and so we need to solve for it numerically.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Matlab, we can use the [`fzero()` function](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/fzero.html), while \n",
    "in Python we can use the [`root_scalar()` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.root_scalar.html) provided in SciPy's `optimize` module.\n",

    "For example, let's see how to solve the equation for eccentric anomaly $E$, part of the\n",

    "where $t$ is the time of flight, $T$ is the orbital period, \n",
    "$e$ is the orbital eccentricity, and $M_e$ is the mean anomaly.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve any nonlinear equation like this using a numerical method, we need to shift\n",
    "the equation to a zero-valued form, like $f(x) = 0$, where $x$ is the root of the equation\n",
    "and what we are trying to find. In this case, that means the equation looks like\n",

    "its iterations. In this case, that is the Prussing estimate: $E_0 = M_e + \\frac{e}{2}$.\n",
