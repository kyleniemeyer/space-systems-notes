    "\n",
    "The Hohmann transfer orbit offers a solution to transferring between two circular orbits, via an elliptic transfer orbit,\n",
    "using the least possible velocity change ($\\Delta v$). It was first recognized/demonstrated by Hohmann in 1925, \n",
    "before the rocket technology to achieve any orbit existed!\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical use of the Hohmann transfer is to start at a lower-altitude circular \"parking orbit\", then use \n",
    "the elliptical transfer orbit to reach a higher-altitude circular orbit. This involves two instantaneous\n",
    "changes in velocity ($\\Delta v$), one at the perigee of the elliptical orbit and one at the apogee (the \"apogee kick\").\n",
